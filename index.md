## The CASE
Your assignment is to create a HTTP api that allows a front-end application to fetch data. 
We want to be able to get items and location, there should be a way to specificy how we want them sorted and / or filtered. 
Use [THESE JSON](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6ljTC_twnrkeFUzN0xhV2xWaHc) files as the data source. 

Requirments: 

* Use Node.js
* HTTP based
* Add docs so we know how to run the example
* Add comments whenever youâ€™re making an assumption 

Put the code in a git repo and send us a mail with a link to the repo or the repo tar ball when you're done, there is no deadline but the sooner the better. You are allowed to make assumptions whenever there's something unclear - how you deal with those are also part of this challenge. ;)
