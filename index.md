## The CASE
Your assignment is to create an HTTP api that allows a front-end application to fetch data. 

We want to be able to get items and locations (and items for a particular location).
There should be a way to specify how we want them sorted and / or filtered. 

Use the following files as data sources:
[ITEMS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmadev/Techcase-Backend/master/items.json) and
[LOCATIONS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmadev/Techcase-Backend/master/locations.json).

Requirements:

* Use Node.js (or something else if instructed to)
* HTTP based
* Add docs so we know how to run the example (assume a freshly installed computer)
* Add comments whenever you make an assumption

Put the code in a git repo and send us a mail with a link to the repo when you're done to mattis@karma.life. There is no deadline but the sooner the better. You are allowed to make assumptions whenever something is unclear - how you deal with those are also part of the challenge.
